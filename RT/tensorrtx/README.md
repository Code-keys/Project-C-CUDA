# TensorRTx

TensorRTx aims to implement popular deep learning networks with tensorrt network definition APIs. As we know, tensorrt has builtin parsers, including caffeparser, uffparser, onnxparser, etc. But when we use these parsers, we often run into some "unsupported operations or layers" problems, especially some state-of-the-art models are using new type of layers.

So why don't we just skip all parsers? We just use TensorRT network definition APIs to build the whole network, it's not so complicated.

I wrote this project to get familiar with tensorrt API, and also to share and learn from the community.

All the models are implemented in pytorch or mxnet first, and export a weights file xxx.wts, and then use tensorrt to load weights, define network and do inference. Some pytorch implementations can be found in my repo [Pytorchx](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/pytorchx), the remaining are from polular open-source implementations.

- `16 Aug 2020`. [upczww](https://github.com/upczww) added a python wrapper for yolov5.
- `14 Aug 2020`. Update yolov5 to v3.0 release.
- `3 Aug 2020`. [BaofengZan](https://github.com/BaofengZan) implemented yolov5 s/m/l/x (yolov5 v2.0 release).
- `6 July 2020`. Add yolov3-tiny, and got 333fps on GTX1080.
- `28 May 2020`. arcface LResNet50E-IR model from [deepinsight/insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) implemented. We got 333fps on GTX1080.
- `22 May 2020`. A new branch [trt4](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/trt4) created, which is using TensorRT 4 API. Now the master branch is using TensorRT 7 API. But only `yolov4` has been migrated to TensorRT 7 API for now. The rest will be migrated soon. And a tutorial for `migarating from TensorRT 4 to 7` provided.
